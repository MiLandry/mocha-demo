# Mocha Demo

## Why
To demo and play with mocha API and Mock API

A flimsy restful web app is provided, but its not really important. Those tests use the Chai assertion library. There are also tests written for just the javascript api to look at other assertion libraries in the 'moretests' folder.

The master branch has a test suite configered, some of the tests are broken intentionally. Maybe I will make a branch to fix them but no reason.
